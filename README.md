# Plagarism-Detector

## Introduction
This project delivers a robust plagiarism detection system developed using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks for comprehensive, step-by-step analysis and demonstration. The primary objective of this tool is to scrutinize textual content, systematically identifying and reporting potential plagiarism by comparing submissions against a pre-existing dataset of source materials.

## Features
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Utilizes tokenization to break text into units, semantic analysis to understand contextual meanings, and similarity detection algorithms to compare the content, ensuring a thorough assessment of text similarities and discrepancies.
- **Interactive Analysis**: Implemented in Jupyter Notebook to provide an interactive environment that allows for detailed exploration of data processing steps and immediate visualization of results.
- **Dataset Comparisons**: Capable of comparing the submitted text against multiple sources simultaneously, leveraging a comprehensive search to detect direct and paraphrased instances of plagiarism.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Offers the ability to set custom similarity thresholds, enabling users to define what percentage of similarity constitutes plagiarism based on their specific criteria.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generates detailed reports highlighting potential plagiarism with direct links to the suspected sources, facilitating easy review and further investigation.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**: NLTK for natural language tasks, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for implementing similarity checks.
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and testing.
